The program will prompt the user to provide the name of an XML file containing a list of URLs for RSS v2.0 feeds. It will then process the XML file to retrieve the RSS feed URLs and generate an HTML page with links to the individual RSS feeds. Additionally, the program will create separate HTML pages for each RSS feed, containing a table of links to all the news items in that feed.
